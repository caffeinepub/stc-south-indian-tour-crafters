# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Hero section's background image to the uploaded houseboat-at-dusk photo and remove the three stat items from the hero.

**Planned changes:**
- Save the uploaded houseboat image as `hero-houseboat.png` and set it as the Hero component's full-screen background, keeping the existing dark overlay
- Remove the "500+ Happy Travellers", "7 Destinations", and "5 Star Review" stat items (and their container) from the Hero section

**User-visible outcome:** The hero section displays the new atmospheric houseboat-at-dusk image as the background, and the stats row is no longer visible. The heading, subheading, and CTA buttons remain unchanged.
