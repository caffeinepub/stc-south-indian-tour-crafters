  "summary": "The diff modifies the Hero component to use a new background image and removes the stats section. REQ-15 appears fully implemented. REQ-14 is partially implemented — the Hero component references 'hero-houseboat.dim_1920x1080.png' but the spec requires saving the image as 'hero-houseboat.png' (without the dimension suffix), and no evidence exists that the image file was actually added to frontend/public/assets/generated/.",

      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Save the uploaded houseboat image as a static asset at frontend/public/assets/generated/hero-houseboat.png",
      "reason": "The diff shows no new files were added (ADDED FILES: none). The image file at frontend/public/assets/generated/hero-houseboat.png is not present in the diff. Additionally, the Hero component references 'hero-houseboat.dim_1920x1080.png' rather than the required 'hero-houseboat.png' filename.",
